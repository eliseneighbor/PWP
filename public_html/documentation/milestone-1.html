<h1>Milestone 1 Write Up</h1>
<body>
<ol><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this PWP is to help me accomplish the goal of securing a job at the end of the bootcamp. I plan to
have both the website itself as something to show my skills with, as well as link to other projects we create in the course. I intend for it to be a living resume
to show recruiters that I have gained a variety of skills over the course of this program.</li>
<li><strong>Audience:</strong> The audience of this site will be future employers and other professionals in the industry. It is designed for people who are recruiting for jobs
in Fullstack, or looking to scope out potential talent. </li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> There are two goals for this project. The first goal is to have a place to display the projects we create during this program
so I can have all my hard work in one easily accessible place. The second goal is to utilize this website to find full time employment by the end of the program
or shortly after graduation.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Persona</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Jim Employerman</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Jim is a recruiter for a nationwide tech company, TechRUs, that is looking for fullstack web developers. Jim uses an iPhone14 and the best corporate Lenovo laptop his company could get their hands on. He is very Interent savvy, as using a computer to look for potential candidates for TechRUs is a big part of his job. He is even skilled at setting up Zoom meetings and remembering to unmute his mic when he wants to speak. He would be accessing my site while on a search for potential candidates for the fullstack developer job that TechRUs is hiring for. He would access it by following a link to it that he finds on my LinkedIn page.</p>
<p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> The frustrations Jim would be facing would be that of any recruiter- he is looking for qualified candidates, but many of his leads are coming up empty. Either the candidates have no proof of their skills, either from a lack of projects to showcase their skills with or maybe a lack of skills at all, or the people who are applying to his ads on sites like Indeed do not have the skills asked for in the job description. All Jim wants is someone who has fullstack skills and can prove it, perhaps with a well build website that contains links to other projects by them.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Jim's goal when he uses this site it to be able to judge for himself whether or not I have fullstack skills and can build a successful website. He wants to be able to do more than take my word for it, he wants concrete proof that this candidate can build a working website from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a recruiter, I want to be able to see qualitative evidence of fullstack knowledge by the creator of this website so I can hire them.</p>

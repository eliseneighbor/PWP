<h1> Milestone 2</h1>
<p> <strong>About Me/Bio: </strong>The top section of my website will have an "About Me/Bio" section. This section will be where I give a short, casual description of who I am, along with a professional headshot. There will also be a menu bar that allows you to jump to sections of the site.</p>
<p><strong>Skills and Strengths: </strong> The second section of my site will be a box with that describes my professional skills and strengths. This will be a more formal part of the site, with less personality and casualness than the Bio part.</p>
<p><strong>Gallery: </strong>The third section of the site is the gallery, which will display examples of my work, including my capstone project and other projects we worked on in class, and anything I do outside of class. When rolling over or clicking on the image, a pop up will appear with more info about the project.</p>
<p><strong>Footer: </strong>The final portion of my site is the footer, which will just provide brief info about the site, like the year it was made, how long it took to work on, and who made it. It will also have a link to the top of the page. It will also have my linkedIn and GitHub linked.</p>
